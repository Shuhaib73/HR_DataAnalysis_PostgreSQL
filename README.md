##### 2. Data Import: Import HR data from an Excel file into the PostgreSQL database, ensuring compatibility with the schema and table structure.
##### 3. Data Analysis: Execute SQL queries to gain insights into employee attrition, job roles, and other relevant HR metrics.
##### 4. Attrition Analysis: Investigate factors contributing to employee attrition, such as business travel, job roles, education, and Job Satisfaction.
##### 5. Tenure Analysis: Determine the average tenure of departing employees in different departments and gender categories.
##### 6. Employee Satisfaction Analysis: Investigate demographic differences in employee satisfaction levels.
##### 7. Years at Company and Job Level Analysis: Identify any correlation between years at the company and job level for current employees, providing insights into career progression and retention.
##### 8. Job Role Distribution: Examine the distribution of employees across various job roles within the organization.

### These analyses provide comprehensive insights into employee retention, demographics, job role distribution, and factors contributing to attrition, enabling data-driven decision-making and HR strategy development.
